# Building Container Images Using Dockerfiles

Creating a container image by hand is possible, but it requires manual processes. There has to be a more automatic way to build images. Manual processes do not scale and are not easily version controlled. Docker provides a solution to this problem - the Dockerfile. In this lab, you will create a Dockerfile to build an image to host a static website.
