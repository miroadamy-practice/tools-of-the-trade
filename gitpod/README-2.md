## Dotfiles

Gitpod will recognize and run one of the following install scripts from your dotfiles repository.

* install.sh
* install
* bootstrap.sh
* bootstrap
* script/bootstrap
* setup.sh
* setup
* script/setup

If there is no install script, your dotfiles will be symlinked into /home/gitpod.

The dotfiles repository installation logs are saved to ~/.dotfiles.log
